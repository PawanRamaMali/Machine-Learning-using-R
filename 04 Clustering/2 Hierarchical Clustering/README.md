# Hierarchical Clustering 

In data mining and statistics, hierarchical clustering (also called hierarchical cluster analysis or HCA) is a method of cluster analysis which seeks to build a hierarchy of clusters. 

Strategies for hierarchical clustering generally fall into two types:

## Agglomerative:
 This is a "bottom-up" approach: each observation starts in its own cluster, and pairs of clusters are merged as one moves up the hierarchy.

## Divisive:
 This is a "top-down" approach: all observations start in one cluster, and splits are performed recursively as one moves down the hierarchy.
